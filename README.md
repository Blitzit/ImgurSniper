# How to use
Imgur Sniper will automatically activate _Snap mode_ when you start the **ImgurSniper.exe** executable. 
You can also enter UI Mode by starting the **ImgurSniper.UI.exe**, which will give you more options for the optimal Snipe. 
The Screen will darken so you definetly will notice when _Snap mode_ is entered.

In _Snap mode_ you are able to **draw/crop a Rectangle** which will crop the content once released and automatically upload it to Imgur or copied to Clipboard. 
For precise cropping, there is a display at the _top of your screen_ which will display you the Display coordinates you are currently on. 
(**WIP:** For even more precision, you can enable the Magnifying glass in the Settings Window.)

When successfully uploaded, you will get a notification and the **Link will be copied to your Clipboard**.


## Thanks for using Imgur Sniper! :)
