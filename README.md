## Why choose ImgurSniper?
Compared to other Screenshot software, ImgurSniper is **as fast as sharing Images can get**. Also, ImgurSniper will upload directly to [imgur](http://www.imgur.com), which gets a direct Image Link 
(Meaning the Link is Image only, so you can embed the Image, or share it with Software that can preview _Image URLs_, like _Discord_, ...)

# How to use
Press _Ctrl + Shift + X_ or _Print Screen_ (depending on your Preferences) to start **ImgurSniper** Snap Mode!
**Easily capture and share a moment** by drawing a Rectangle with your _Mouse_ to automatically upload it to [Imgur](http://www.imgur.com)!
Optionally, press _Spacebar_ to _switch Mode_ and **paint on the Screen**!
You can now **share the Link** that has been **copied to your Clipboard** with everyone!

(To change the behavior of **ImgurSniper**, right-click the _Icon in your Tray_ and click **Settings**)

(See more Info at **ImgurSniper Settings -> Help**)
