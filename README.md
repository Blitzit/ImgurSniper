# Description
_**ImgurSniper** is a small and lightweight tool that makes sharing Images way easier by instantly uploading them to imgur.com **or** copy them to your Clipboard._

# How to use
Imgur Sniper will automatically activate _Snap mode_ when you start the **ImgurSniper.exe** executable.
You can also enter [UI Mode](https://github.com/mrousavy/ImgurSniper#imgursniper-ui) by starting the **ImgurSniper.UI.exe**, which will give you more options.
The Screen will darken so you definetly will notice when _Snap mode_ is entered. To exit _Snap mode_, you have to press
**[ESC]**.

In _Snap mode_ you are able to **draw/crop a Rectangle** which will crop the content once released and automatically upload it to Imgur or copy to your Clipboard.
When successfully uploaded, you will get a notification once the **Link is copied to your Clipboard**.

**Side note:** You may experience _issues_ with Image uploads being _cut or not uploaded_,
this is because of Imgur's File size limit for not logged in Users. You can easily fix this by _logging in_.

# ImgurSniper UI
