# How to use
Imgur Sniper will automatically activate _Snap mode_ when you start the **ImgurSniper.exe** executable.
_Snap mode_ will be launched on the Screen your _Mouse Cursor_ is currently located.
You can also enter [UI Mode](https://github.com/mrousavy/ImgurSniper#imgursniper-ui) by starting the **ImgurSniper.UI.exe**, which will give you more options for the optimal Snipe. 
The Screen will darken so you definetly will notice when _Snap mode_ is entered. To exit _Snap mode_, you have to press
**[ESC]**.

In _Snap mode_ you are able to **draw/crop a Rectangle** which will crop the content once released and automatically upload it to Imgur or copy to your Clipboard. 
For precise cropping, there is a display at the _top of your screen_ which will display you the Display coordinates you are currently on. 
(**WIP:** Magnifying Glass)
When successfully uploaded, you will get a notification and the **Link will be copied to your Clipboard**.

**Side note:** You may experience _issues_ with Image uploads being _cut or not uploaded_,
this is because of Imgur's File size limit for not logged in Users. You can easily fix this by _logging in_.
